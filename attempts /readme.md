Extra Practice Questions:

(BubbleSort)

1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input. It should output an array of those same numbers sorted from lowest to highest.

sample input = [5,6,1,3,4,2]
Expected output = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Research Areas:

1. Loops
2. Array Methods

(Loops) 2. Staircase problem
Create a function that takes an integer and console logs a step shaped stair with the integer levels using the # character

e.g steps(2) # ##

    steps(3)  #
              ##
              ###

Research Areas

1. Array methods
2. Nested Loops
3. Conditional statements

(Objects) 3. Write a JavaScript program to get the volume of a Cylinder with four decimal places using object classes.
Volume of a cylinder : V = πr2h where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder.

Research Areas

1. Objects.
2. Object constructor.
3. constructor templates.Extra Practice Questions:
